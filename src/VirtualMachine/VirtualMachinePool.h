 * @date 02/02/20
 * @file VirtualMachinePool.h
 * @brief  This manages a collection of VirtualMachines -- this is what handles the enumeration of flip by probability. 
 * 			Basically each machine state stores the state of some evaluator and is able to push things back on to the Q
 * 			if it encounters a random flip
 * 			This stores pointers because it is impossible to copy out of std collections, so we are constantly
 * 			having to call VirtualMachineState constructors. Using pointers speeds us up by about 20%.
