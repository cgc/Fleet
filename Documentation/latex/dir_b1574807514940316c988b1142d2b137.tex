file \mbox{\hyperlink{_astar_8h}{Astar.\+h}}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em This is an implementation of kinda-\/\+A$\ast$ search that maintains a priority queue of partial states and attempts to find a program with the lowest posterior score. To do this, we choose a node to expand based on its prior plus N\+\_\+\+R\+E\+PS samples of its likelihood, computed by filling in its children at random. This stochastic heuristic is actually inadmissable since it usually overestimates the cost. As a result, it usually makes sense to run A$\ast$ at a pretty high temperature, corresponding to a downweighting of the likelihood, and making the heuristic more likely to be admissable. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
file \mbox{\hyperlink{_chain_pool_8h}{Chain\+Pool.\+h}}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em A \mbox{\hyperlink{class_chain_pool}{Chain\+Pool}} stores a bunch of M\+C\+M\+C\+Chains and allows you to run them serially or in parallel. N\+O\+TE\+: When you use a \mbox{\hyperlink{class_chain_pool}{Chain\+Pool}}, the results will not be reproducible with seed because timing determines when you switch chains. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
file \mbox{\hyperlink{_control_8h}{Control.\+h}}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em This bundles together information for running M\+C\+MC or M\+C\+TS, including number of steps, amount of time, etc. N\+O\+TE\+: In general this should N\+OT be passed by reference because we want start\+\_\+time to be the time we started the function it is passed to (start time is the time of construction, here) \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
file \mbox{\hyperlink{_enumeration_inference_8h}{Enumeration\+Inference.\+h}}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em Enumeration inferences enumerates hypotheses using a counting algorithm from the grammar. It supports multithreading and requires a hypothesis, grammar, start type, and callback. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
file \mbox{\hyperlink{_m_c_m_c_chain_8h}{M\+C\+M\+C\+Chain.\+h}}
\item 
file \mbox{\hyperlink{_m_c_t_s_8h}{M\+C\+T\+S.\+h}}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em This is a version of M\+C\+TS that plays out children nplayouts times instead of expanding a full tree. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
file \mbox{\hyperlink{_parallel_inference_interface_8h}{Parallel\+Inference\+Interface.\+h}}
\item 
file \mbox{\hyperlink{_parallel_tempering_8h}{Parallel\+Tempering.\+h}}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em This is a chain pool that runs multiple chains on a ladder of different temperatures and adjusts temperatures in order to balances swaps up and down the ladder (which makes it efficient). The adaptation scheme follows \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.05823}{\texttt{ https\+://arxiv.\+org/abs/1501.\+05823}} N\+O\+TE This starts two extra threads, one for adapting and one for swapping, but they mostly wait around. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
file \mbox{\hyperlink{_prior_inference_8h}{Prior\+Inference.\+h}}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em Inference by sampling from the prior -- doesn\textquotesingle{}t tend to work well, but might be a useful baseline. \end{DoxyCompactList}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
