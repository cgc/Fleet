\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em This is an implementation of beam search that maintains a priority queue of partial states and attempts to find a program with the lowest posterior score. To do this, we choose a node to expand based on its prior plus N\+\_\+\+R\+E\+PS samples of its likelihood, computed by filling in its children at random. This stochastic heuristic is actually inadmissable (in A$\ast$ terms) since it usually overestimates the cost. As a result, it usually makes sense to run at a pretty high temperature, corresponding to a downweighting of the likelihood, and making the heuristic more likely to be admissable. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
file \mbox{\hyperlink{_control_8h}{Control.\+h}}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em This class has all the information for running M\+C\+MC or M\+C\+TS in a little package. It defaultly constructs (via \mbox{\hyperlink{struct_control}{Control()}}) to read these from \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_fleet_args}{Fleet\+Args}}, which are a bunch of variables set by Fleet\+::initialize from the command line. This makes it especially convenient to call with command line arguments, but others can be specified as well. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item
