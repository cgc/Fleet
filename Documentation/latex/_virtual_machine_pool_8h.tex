This manages a collection of Virtual\+Machines -- this is what handles the enumeration of flip by probability. Basically each machine state stores the state of some evaluator and is able to push things back on to the Q if it encounters a random flip This stores pointers because it is impossible to copy out of std collections, so we are constantly having to call \hyperlink{class_virtual_machine_state}{Virtual\+Machine\+State} constructors. Using pointers speeds us up by about 20\%.
