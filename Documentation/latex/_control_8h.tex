This bundles together information for running M\+C\+MC or M\+C\+TS, including number of steps, amount of time, etc. N\+O\+TE\+: In general this should N\+OT be passed by reference because we want start\+\_\+time to be the time we started the function it is passed to (start time is the time of construction, here)
