This is an implementation of beam search that maintains a priority queue of partial states and attempts to find a program with the lowest posterior score. To do this, we choose a node to expand based on its prior plus N\+\_\+\+R\+E\+PS samples of its likelihood, computed by filling in its children at random. This stochastic heuristic is actually inadmissable (in A$\ast$ terms) since it usually overestimates the cost. As a result, it usually makes sense to run at a pretty high temperature, corresponding to a downweighting of the likelihood, and making the heuristic more likely to be admissable.

\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
This is an implementation of beam search that maintains a priority queue of partial states and attempts to find a program with the lowest posterior score. To do this, we choose a node to expand based on its prior plus N\+\_\+\+R\+E\+PS samples of its likelihood, computed by filling in its children at random. This stochastic heuristic is actually inadmissable (in A$\ast$ terms) since it usually overestimates the cost. As a result, it usually makes sense to run at a pretty high temperature, corresponding to a downweighting of the likelihood, and making the heuristic more likely to be admissable. 

One general challenge is how to handle -\/inf likelihoods, and here we\textquotesingle{}ve done that by, if you end up with -\/inf, taking your parent\textquotesingle{}s temperature and multiplying by P\+A\+R\+E\+N\+T\+\_\+\+P\+E\+N\+A\+L\+TY.

T\+O\+DO\+: Is it worth making this stochastic, so we sample the the expansion with the probabilities and some temperature?
